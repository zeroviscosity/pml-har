The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset provides a wide range of measurements for subjects performing weight-lifting exercises along with an indicator for how well the exercise was performed. In this study we will be building a model to predict that outcome from a subset of the measurements.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(caret)
```

```{r}
set.seed(54321)
trainingAll <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
dim(trainingAll)
```

The training set has 160 columns and 19622 rows. Examining the data reveals that many of these columns can be dropped. The first 7 columns contain metadata about the subject, when the entry occurred, etc. Many other columns contain primarily NA or empty strings. We will subset the dataframe to only include data-rich columns.

```{r}
trainingSubset <- trainingAll[, c(8:11, 37:49, 60:68, 84:86, 102, 113:124, 140, 151:160)]
names(trainingSubset)
```

We will use k-fold cross validation with k set to 8.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
k = 8
folds <- createFolds(trainingSubset$classe, k)
sapply(folds, length)
```

We need to split each fold into a training and test set.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
training <- list()
testing <- list()
for (i in 1:k) {
  fold <- trainingSubset[folds[[i]],]
  inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=fold$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
  training[[i]] <- fold[inTrain,]
  testing[[i]] <- fold[-inTrain,]
}
```

Now that we have our training and test sets, we will build a Random Forest predictor. We will use Random Forest because it tends to be accurate and it works well with non-linear data.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
modFit <- list()
for (i in 1:k) {
  modFit[[i]] <- train(classe ~ ., method="rf", data=training[[i]])
}
# Example
modFit[[1]]
```

To calculate the in-sample error rate we will average the results from each fold.

```{r}
mean(sapply(modFit, function(m) { 1 - max(m$results$Accuracy) }))
```

Now we will test our predictors on our test sets.

```{r}
pred <- list()
for (i in 1:k) {
  pred[[i]] <- predict(modFit[[i]], testing[[i]])
}
# Example
table(pred[[1]], testing[[1]]$classe)
```

To calculate the out-of-sample error rate we will first calculate the error rate on each fold and then average them.

```{r}
errorRate <- sapply(1:k, function(i) {
  correct <- pred[[i]] == testing[[i]]$classe
  1 - sum(correct) / length(correct)
})
errorRate
mean(errorRate)
```

Surprisingly, the out-of-sample error rate is in fact lower than the in-sample error rate. It is now time to apply our predictors to the test set.

```{r}
testingAll <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
dim(testingAll)
```

We will subset the testing data in the same way as the training data.

```{r}
testingSubset <- testingAll[, c(8:11, 37:49, 60:68, 84:86, 102, 113:124, 140, 151:160)]
```

We will apply each predictor to the test set.

```{r}
predictions <- sapply(1:8, function(i) {
  predict(modFit[[i]], testingSubset)
})
predictions
```

While there is agreement for most of the examples, there are a few discrepancies. Using a "majority rules" approach, we run into issue with #8 and #19 as they are evenly split. In those cases we will use the letter predicted by the seventh predictor, as it had the lowest out-of-sample error rate.

```{r}
answers <- c("B","A","B","A","A","E","D","B","A","A","B","C","B","A","E","E","A","B","B","B")
```

We will use the suggested function for saving the predictions as files.

```{r}
pml_write_files = function(x) {
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_", i, ".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file=filename, quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(answers)
```

This strategy resulted in 20/20 correct answers. The Random Forest approach clearly works well with this sort of data.
